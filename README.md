Overview:

In this excercise we are given FizzBuzz Challenge to print integers with associate fizz and buzz outputs.

How to run:
else if statement:
If the number is divisible by 3 the system will print out Fizz
If the number is divisible by 5 the system will print out Buzz


                    // If number is divisible by 15 ( 5 * 3)

                    if (number % 15 == 0) {

                        System.out.printf("%s ", FIZZ_BUZZ);

                    } else if (number % 3 == 0) { // If number is divisible by 3

                        System.out.printf("%s ", FIZZ);

                    } else if (number % 5 == 0) { // If number is divisible by 5

                        System.out.printf("%s ", BUZZ);

                    } else {

                        System.out.printf("%d ", number);

                    }


Summary:
created a scanner the system output to user for enter number and the system will plrint out fizz or buzz depending on the user input.
